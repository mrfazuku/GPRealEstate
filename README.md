GPRealEstate
============

Grief Prevention - Real Estate aims to extend the Grief Prevention plugin by allowing users to be able to buy and sell claims or subclaims. 
Currently this is one of the biggest requests that are made for this plugin and the author has pointed out that they are concentrating 
on anti-griefing aspect of GP and that the API is there for anyone that wants to help extend the project! 
Originally the was started by leezallen, then taken over by SuperPyroManiac.

The project had been stale for a few months, so I, MrFazuku, forked the project in an attempt to fix an issue with sub-claims not being
properly assigned to the UUID of the player upon purchase.
